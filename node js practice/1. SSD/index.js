// Server-side development involves writing code that runs on the server (not the user's browser) to handle requests, process data, and send responses back to the client. In Node.js, this includes:

// Setting up a web server.
// Handling HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.).
// Routing requests to appropriate handlers.
// Processing data and generating dynamic responses.
